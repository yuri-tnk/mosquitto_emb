   This is a port of the Mosquitto MQTT client for the embedded MCU with
BearSSL client (thanks to Roger Light and Thomas Pornin for their
really great software).

   Current port was compiled at Linux as the debug platform. It was
tested with a local Mosquitto broker(with and without SSL) and
with Amazon AWS IoT service (TLS 1.2 with mutual authentication)
